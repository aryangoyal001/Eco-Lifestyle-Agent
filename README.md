## 🌱 Task 1 – Eco Lifestyle Agent (AI Sustainability Assistant)

- This is my **Eco Lifestyle Agent project** for the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship on AI & Cloud technologies** program.
  - It's an AI-powered assistant that helps users make **eco-friendly lifestyle choices** through natural conversations, powered by IBM Watson Assistant and cloud technologies.

---

## 🌍 Project Description

- I built an **AI chatbot** that gives users tips on living sustainably — like reducing plastic use, saving electricity, or understanding recycling rules.
- It also shares **government schemes** like **PM-KUSUM** or **Rooftop Solar Subsidy**, helping users adopt green solutions easily.
- The assistant is deployed on a **web chat UI** using **Watson Assistant's web integration**, with plans to expand to RAG-based extensions.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Educate users about **green habits**, recycling, and energy saving.
- Build a real-time assistant using **Watsonx Assistant** on IBM Cloud.
- Integrate natural language queries (NLP) with guided actions.
- Optionally enhance with **OpenAPI / RAG-style retrieval** for dynamic data.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Web Chat Assistant**: Embedded and styled using IBM's web chat preview builder.
- **Watson Actions**: Built using Watsonx's low-code Actions UI.
- **Custom Responses**: Covers topics like travel, plastic reduction, solar energy, etc.
- **OpenAPI Extension (Optional)**: Connects to mock API endpoints to simulate real-time responses.
- **Disambiguation & Suggestions**: Smart fallback and clarifying options when needed.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **IBM Watsonx Assistant**
- **IBM Cloud Lite (jp-tok Region)**
- **Watson Web Chat Embed**
- **OpenAPI Extensions (optional)**
- **CSV/XLSX** for training actions
- **HTML** for chat integration

---

## 🔁 How It Works (Flow)

1. User opens the **Eco Lifestyle Agent** chat window.
2. Types a query like: “How can I reduce plastic use?”
3. Assistant matches the intent and replies with eco tips.
4. For queries like “Solar scheme”, it fetches from static or RAG-like source.
5. Disambiguation or fallback options help guide users when needed.
